# Online Shopping Web Application

An online shopping web application developed using both **frontend** and **backend technologies** to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. This application allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.

## Features

### 1. **Responsive User Interface**
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** are used to build a responsive and interactive frontend.
- The application provides a clean, user-friendly layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

### 2. **Product Browsing**
- Users can browse through a variety of products listed with relevant information such as name, price, and description.
- The UI is designed to provide easy navigation and quick access to product details.

### 3. **Shopping Cart Functionality**
- **Add Products**: Users can add products to their shopping cart directly from the product listing page.
- **Remove Products**: Items can be removed from the cart at any time before checkout.
- **Update Quantities**: Users can update the quantity of products in the cart, which automatically updates the total price.

### 4. **Checkout System**
- The application allows users to proceed to checkout after reviewing their shopping cart.
- Basic **checkout functionality** includes capturing user details (name, address, etc.), calculating the total price, and simulating payment processing.
  
### 5. **Backend Integration**
- The backend is designed to manage product listings, handle cart operations, and simulate order processing.
- **Database Management**: A simple backend system (e.g., using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB or SQL) to manage products, cart data, and user information.
  
### 6. **User Authentication** *(Optional, if implemented)*
- If implemented, the application allows users to register, log in, and view past orders.
